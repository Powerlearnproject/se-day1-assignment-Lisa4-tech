Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the study of software design, development and maintenance and it is important in technology because it offers solutions to fulfill end usre needs through evolving design and development

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Change analysis; changes made to code are tested to check output and if it works it is implemented
Release planning; all proposed changes are considered
Releasing a system; a design is made with implementation of the next version of the system

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Problem analysis and planning; Identifying preoblems and planning to rectify them
Designing; Creating a guide to make it function as it should
Development testing; Following the set guidelines of code
Deployment; Deploy the software into testing and production environment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is sequential and rigid with phases completed in order for example in manufacturing projects
Agile methodology is flexible and iterative, focusesd on continuous improvement and adaptation for example in an online shopping mobile application

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer roles:
  Designing and creating software
  Make records of operations for future use
  Maintain software for optimum performance
Quality assurance engineer role:
  Constructing a process for product inspection
  Detection and resolution of arising issues
  Providing feedback that products meet quality requirements
Project manager role:
  Monitoring progress
  Overseeing software development teams
  Delegating duties and tasks

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs help developers to write code faster and more efficiently for example VS code and AWS Cloud9
VCS help developers to keep track of changes to code, files and other digital assets for example Git and AWS CodeCommit

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Adapting to latest market trends, solution being ensuring developers stay up to date on new technologies, market trends and upcoming software trends
2. Quality assuarance, solution being ensuring the test plans covers all requirements to be delivered by planning several cycles of testing
3. Security, solution being following best practices such as penetration testing, code review and high level programming language

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is the smallest testable part of software system, it is important because it ensures code is developed properly at every single unit of the software
Integration testing isto check whether the combined units work well together as a group, it is important becauseit detects flaws in the interactions between the units and ensures the system components run as required
System testing is the complete software system as a whole, it is important becauseit verifies the product's compliance and functionality and quality
Acceptance testing is where the product is validated by end user's expectations, it is important becauseitfocuses on overall system quality, content and performance and if issues are detected, they can be resolved early

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing inputs for AI tools that will produce optimal outputs
Its importance is improving the quality of AI generated content

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt "Show me an image of flowers"
Improved prompt "Show me an image of pink carnations with white tulips in a bridal bouquet"
The improved prompt is more effective because it offers specific terms for the type of flowers and the kind of display required
